### Skeleton
#### Wireframes - Initial Design
Initially the idea was to design a store, either a pet store or a restaurant. Where the user would be able to register, login, comment and interact by being able to make appointments and reserve a dinner table. With time this has changed into the blog where we post recipes and users can interact.
